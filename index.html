      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Enthusiastic and driven. After an extensive career in the luxury beauty industry, I am a student passionate about entering a career in coding and technology. With growing experience in HTML and CSS, I enjoy crafting visually appealing and responsive websites. My study and application of JavaScript allows me to add interactive features, making web experiences engaging and user-friendly. I am also developing my skills in Python, which I use for automating tasks and building simple applications. Problem-solving intrigues me and I thrive when learning new programming concepts. Eager to collaborate and always willing to listen and learn, I am committed to growing as a developer and contributing creative solutions in every project I undertake. I would like a career focussed in artificial intelligence, cyber security or gaming and will continue to study the appropriate courses and extend my qualifications to achieve this result.
